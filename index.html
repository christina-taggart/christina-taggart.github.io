                  <p> I wear many hats for this small startup. Coding in JavaScript, Ruby, HTML &amp; CSS. Helping to launch the kickstarter campaign that brought in our first users. Tackling business goals such as increasing traction through user centered design. Establishing our company's user experience framework with the goal of optimizing our product's end to end user experience. Conducting user research and transforming learnings into designs, code specs, and agile sprints. Leading the remote dev team, collaborating regularly with the CEO and Head of Marketing to set priorities, and managing task execution through daily scrums and lean methodologies.</p>
                  <p><strong>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</strong><br/>
                    Users did not want to login with Facebook; I prototyped an email login flow that dramatically increases product accessibility. Users were confused about what an awesome box is; I created a new homepage that increased clarity and visitor-to-customer conversions. Users were abandoning the app during box setup, card creation, and sending invitations; I streamlined these main user touch points, improving bounce rates.</p>

                  <p>My first step in designing creative solutions is to turn to our users. As a team we've established our main personas, business goals, and company brand. When I oversee new feature development or the enhancement of existing user flows, I keep these in mind and begin user research. To identify current user needs I conduct: usability testing, user interviews, user feedback surveys, synthesize customer service requests, ab test, and interpret google analytics usage data.</p>

                  <p>With limited resources and a seemingly neverending task list, I must frequently discern which tasks need to happen today, this week, this month, or even this year. I tee up issues for team discussion, manage expectations, plan milestones, and organize tasks into priority order based on time-per-task estimates, user needs, and business goals. We use github for task management, measuring progress over time, generating more realistic time estimates for coding tasks, and to manage developers working remotely.</p>

Then I hone in and iterate on a few ideas that are most viable and in line with the longer term product vision.

These interactive user flows bring shared understanding to the team of the big picture task at hand as well as the nitty gritty details required for code implementation. User testing the prototype uncovers usability issues and validates design solutions.</p>

                  <p>Whether its implementing new features, enhancements, bug fixing, refactoring, or QA, a top priority in coding is to benefit the product and overall user experience. To 'put out fires' I problem solve to find quick fixes that give me time to implement longer term, more robust solutions. Through 7th generation thinking I make code more modular, documented, or easier for future developers to work with. Through good code, I've made the product easier to use, more intuitive, and more reliable. </p>

                  <p>Working with a small team of developers, designers, and user experience professionals, we created a mobile application prototype designed to help Rutgers University students grow their professional networks and enhance their careers. I brought innovative ideas and plenty of enthusiasm to the team, as well as facilitated communication, led user testing, and organized the final pitch presentation.</p>

                 <h2>Contextual Inquiry &amp;<br/> Persona Development</h2>
                  <p>We interviewed 20 undergraduate and graduate students on campus at Rutgers University, asking questions about majors, career goals, role models, interests, hobbies, learning styles, influences, daily lives, most used devices, and vision for the future. Then we developed personas from the fuzzy wanderer, who has little or no direction, no declared major, lacks role models, vague or no notion of an ideal job, and who believes time will help figure everything out, to the laser focused overachiever, who has a clear direction, declared major, strong role models, and is passionately pursuing a career. </p>

For students who don't know what they want to do, and are not looking for a job yet, they need: a non-threatening environment, guidance and support from peers and potential mentors, encouragement to explore new activities, reinforement for existing interests, and opportunities for self discovery. For students who know what they want to do and are interested in looking for a job: they need: the ability to get in touch with the person who will ultimately help get his/her next job, browse available jobs and hiring companies, compare and contrast job opportunities and detailed career pathways.</p>

Through rapid iterative design, mapping out user stories, and whiteboarding, we established the main goals of our app: give users an easy way to connect with mentors including teachers, professionals, and peers, and give users access to events of interest including netowrking opportunities, and career fairs. User testing affirmed that this is a worthwhile concept with traction, and provided insight for future design iterations. </p>
